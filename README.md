# Lost-and-Found

This is a simple Java project aimed at solving the issue of lost identity cards and passports. The main objective of this project is to determine how to reduce the rate of lost identity cards and passports even important documents as they can be retrieved and returned to the owner, with this having to reduce the time taken to replace it. 

Generally, this system is best suited for institutional and even nation wide use when scaled up and proper infrastructure is in place. This system will save on the number of reported lost national identity cards and passports at the police station and save time and resources used in replacement.

Problem Statement:
The rate of reported stolen or lost national identity cards and passports is quite high.
The time required for the appplication process for a renewal process of both the national identity card and passport are quite long and tidious, whereby an abstract is needed and also an affidavit which seems to be a long process.
